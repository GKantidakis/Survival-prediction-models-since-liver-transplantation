# Survival-prediction-models-since-liver-transplantation
This repository stores the R-code for the comparison between Cox models and machine-learning techniques.

The Cox models applied are: 
1) A cox model with 106 prognostic factors (52 regarding donor and 54 regarding patient characteristics)
2) A Cox model with backward elimination
3) A Cox model with LASSO selection

The machine learning applied are: 

A) A random survival forest
B) A partial logistic artificial neural network with 1 hidden layer
C) A partial logistic artificial neural network with 2 hidden layers
